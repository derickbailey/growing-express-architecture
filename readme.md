## Growing Express Architecture: Users, Features and Teams

Presented At [JSRemoteConf](http://jsremoteconf.com), Jan 15, 2016 2:30 PM EST

## The Session

With the raw power of the V8 engine and many options for building web apps with Express, it's easy to see why Node + Express are a near ubiquitous combination. But, with the seemingly infinite flexibility of Express and JavaScript, it can be overwhelming to look at a project and not have a sense of how to organize everything it needs. How do you organize routers, for example? How much code belongs in them? Where does business logic live? What happens when the team grows, or you get more users; does that affect code organization? As the number of users, features and developers begins to grow, these questions - and more - become critical. From the file system to keeping routers clean and simple, this session will show you the solutions that have served well in apps of all sizes. You'll see how little it takes to grow a web application with new features, new users and new development team members.
